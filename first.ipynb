If I recall correctly, files2rouge relies on the Perl, script, which among other things normalizes all numbers to a special token: in the case you presented, this should account for a good chunk of the difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may end up adding in more versions of the metric, but probably not for a while (@lhoestq correct me if I'm wrong). However, feel free to take a stab at adding it in yourself and submitting a PR if you're interested!\", \"Thank you for your kind answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a side question : Isn't it better to have a package that normalize more ?\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand to idea of having a package that does minimal post-processing for transparency.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it means that people using different architecture (with different tokenizers for example) will have difference in ROUGE scores even if their predictions are actually similar.  \\r\\nThe goal of `nlp` is to have _one package to rule them all_, right ?\\r\\n\\r\\nI will look into it but I'm not sure I have the required skill for this ^^ \", \"You're right, there's a pretty interesting trade-off here between robustness and sensitivity :) The flip side of your argument is that we also still want the metric to be sensitive to model mistakes. How we think about number normalization for example has evolved a fair bit since the Perl script was written: at the time, ROUGE was used mostly to evaluate short-medium text summarization systems, where there were only a few numbers in the input and it was assumed that the most popular methods in use at the time would get those right. However, as your example showcases, that assumption does not hold any more, and we do want to be able to penalize a model that generates a wrong numerical value.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, we think that abstracting away tokenization differences is the role of the model/tokenizer: if you use the 🤗Tokenizers library for example, it will handle that for you ;)\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, there is a lot of active research on developing model-powered metrics that are both more sensitive and more robust than ROUGE. Check out for example BERTscore, which is implemented in this library!\"] | ['I second this request. The bottom line is that **scores produced with different reference tokenizations are not comparable**. To discourage (even inadvertent) cheating, the user should never touch the reference. The `v13a` tokenization standard is not ideal, but at least it has been consistently used at matrix.statmt.org, facilitating comparisons.\\r\\n\\r\\nSacrebleu exposes [all its data sources](https://github.com/mjpost/sacrebleu/blob/master/sacrebleu/dataset.py) and additionally provides [an API](https://github.com/mjpost/sacrebleu/blob/master/sacrebleu/__init__.py) to accessing the references, which seem to fit within the spirit of your codebase.', \"Didn't we have a slide and discussion at WMT admitting that, for production-quality models, BLEU doesn't correlate with human eval anyway?\\r\\n\", \"Yes, there are slides like that at WMT every year :) BLEU correlates with human judgment only at coarse levels, and it seems to be getting worse when people try to use it to do model selection among high-performing neural systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the point isn't whether BLEU is a good metric, but whether your BLEU score can be compared to other BLEU scores. They only can be compared if you use the same reference tokenization (similar to how you [can't compare LM perplexities across different segmentations](https://sjmielke.com/comparing-perplexities.htm)). sacrebleu was an attempt to get everyone to use WMT's reference tokenization (meaning, your system has to first remove its own tokenization) so that you could just compare across papers. This also prevents scores from being gamed.\", \"I do not consider as a sufficient solution switching this library's default metric from BLEU to the wrapper around SacreBLEU. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs currently implemented, the wrapper allows end users to toggle SacreBLEU options, but doesn't pass along the SacreBLEU signature. As @mjpost showed in [Post18](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-6319.pdf), it's simply not credible to assume that people will stick to the defaults, therefore, the signature is necessary to be explicit about what options were used. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the `v13a` or `intl` options for the SacreBLEU `tokenize` argument, which was pointed out earlier, papers frequently differ on whether they lowercase text before scoring (`lowercase`) and the smoothing method used (`smooth_method`). BLEU scores can differ substantially (over 1 BLEU) just by changing these options. \\r\\n\\r\\nLosing the SacreBLEU signature is a regression in reproducibility and clarity.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Perhaps this should belong in a separate issue?)\", 'Thanks for sharing your thoughts. This is a very important discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso one of the first items on our mid-term roadmap (we will try to clean it and share it soon) is to introduce mechanisms to get high-quality traceability and reproducibility for all the processes related to the library.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo having the signature for `sacrebleu` is really important!\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding BLEU, I guess we can just remove it from the canonical metrics included in the repo itself (it won\\'t prevent people to add it as \"user-metrics\" but at least we won\\'t be promoting it).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a more general note (definitely too large for the scope of this issue) we are wondering, with @srush in particular, how we could handle the selection of metrics/datasets with the most community-based and bottom-up approach possible. If you have opinions on this, please share!', 'Yeah, I would love to have discussions about ways this project can have an community-based, transparent process to arrive at strong default metrics. @kpu / @mjpost do you have any suggestions of how that might work or pointers to places where this is done right? Perhaps this question can be template for what is likely to be repeated for other datasets.', \"I think @bittlingmayer is referring to Figure 6 in http://statmt.org/wmt19/pdf/53/WMT02.pdf .  When you look at Appendix A there are some cases where metrics fall apart at the high end and some where they correlate well.  en-zh is arguably production-quality.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis could evolve into a metrics Bazaar where the value add is really the packaging and consistency: it installs/compiles the metrics for me, gives a reproducible name to use in publication (involve the authors; you don't want a different sacrebleu hash system), a version number, and evaluation of the metrics like http://ufallab.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~bojar/wmt19-metrics-task-package.tgz but run when code changes rather than once a year.  \", 'While a Bazaar setup works for models / datasets, I am not sure it is ideal for metrics ? Ideal from my perspective would be to have tasks with metrics moderated by experts who document, cite, and codify known pitchfalls (as above^) and make it non-trivial for beginners to mess it up. ', '@srush @thomwolf \\r\\n\\r\\nModelFront could provide (automated, \"QE-based\") evaluation for all the pretrained translation models you host.  Not bottom-up and not valid for claiming SoTA, but independent, practical for builders and not top-down.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor that I would also suggest some diverse benchmarks (so split it out into datasets with only user-generated data, or only constants, or only UI strings, or only READMEs) which tease out known trade-offs.  Even hypothetical magic eval is limited if we always reduce it to a single number.\\r\\n\\r\\nRealistically people want to know how a model compares to an API like Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, DeepL or Yandex (especially for a language pair like EN:RU, or for the many languages that only Yandex supports), and that could be done too.\\r\\n', 'Very important discussion.\\r\\nI am trying to understand the effects of tokenization.\\r\\nI wanted to ask which is a good practice.\\r\\nSacrebleu should be used on top of the tokenized output, or detokenized(raw) text?', 'Use sacrebleu on detokenized output and raw unmodified references.

My plan is to add an axis variable in the `concatenate_datasets` function in `arrow_dataset.py` and when that is set to 1 concatenate columns instead of rows. ', \"Hi ! I would love to see this feature implemented as well :) Thank you for proposing your help !\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a few things about the current implementation:\\r\\n- A dataset object is a wrapper of one `pyarrow.Table` that contains the data\\r\\n- Pyarrow offers an API that allows to transform Table objects. For example there are functions like `concat_tables`, `Table.rename_columns`, `Table.add_column` etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore adding columns from another dataset is possible thanks to the pyarrow API and in particular `Table.add_column` :) \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever this breaks some features we have regarding pickle. A dataset object can be pickled and unpickled without loading all the data in memory. It is useful for multiprocessing for example. Pickling a dataset object is possible thanks to the `Dataset._data_files` which defines the list of arrow files that will be used to form the final Table (basically all the data from each files are concatenated on axis 0).\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore to be able to add columns to a Dataset and still be able to work with it in a multiprocessing setup, we need to extend this last aspect to be able to reconstruct a Table object from multiple arrow files that are combined in both axis 0 and 1. Currently this reconstruction mechanism only supports axis 0.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm sure we can figure something out that enables users to add columns from another dataset while keeping the multiprocessing support.\", '@lhoestq, we have two Pull Requests to implement:\\r\\n- Dataset.add_item: #1870\\r\\n- Dataset.add_column: #2145\\r\\nwhich add a single row or column, repectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe request here is to implement the concatenation of *multiple* rows/columns. Am I right?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should agree on the API:\\r\\n- `concatenate_datasets` with `axis`?\\r\\n- other Dataset method name?', \"For the API, I like `concatenate_datasets` with `axis` personally :)\\r\\nFrom a list of `Dataset` objects, it would concatenate them to a new `Dataset` object backed by a `ConcatenationTable`, that is the concatenation of the tables of each input dataset. The concatenation is either on axis=0 (append rows) or on axis=1 (append columns).\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding what we need to implement:\\r\\nThe axis=0 is already supported and is the current behavior of `concatenate_datasets`.\\r\\nAlso `add_item` is not needed to implement axis=1 (though it's an awesome addition to this library).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo implement axis=1, we either need `add_column` or a `ConcatenationTable` constructor to concatenate tables horizontally.\\r\\nI have a preference for using a `ConcatenationTable` constructor because this way we can end up with a `ConcatenationTable` with only 1 additional block per table, while `add_column` would add 1 block per new column.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe we can simply have an equivalent of `ConcatenationTable.from_tables` but for axis=1 ?\\r\\n`axis` could also be an argument of `ConcatenationTable.from_tables`\", '@lhoestq I think I guessed your suggestions in advance... 😉 #2151', \"Cool !

However, feel free to take a stab at adding it in yourself and submitting a PR if you're interested!\\\", \\\"Thank you for your kind answer.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs a side question : Isn't it better to have a package that normalize more ?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI understand to idea of having a package that does minimal post-processing for transparency.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut it means that people using different architecture (with different tokenizers for example) will have difference in ROUGE scores even if their predictions are actually similar.  \\\\r\\\\nThe goal of `nlp` is to have _one package to rule them all_, right ?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI will look into it but I'm not sure I have the required skill for this ^^ \\\", \\\"You're right, there's a pretty interesting trade-off here between robustness and sensitivity :) The flip side of your argument is that we also still want the metric to be sensitive to model mistakes. How we think about number normalization for example has evolved a fair bit since the Perl script was written: at the time, ROUGE was used mostly to evaluate short-medium text summarization systems, where there were only a few numbers in the input and it was assumed that the most popular methods in use at the time would get those right. However, as your example showcases, that assumption does not hold any more, and we do want to be able to penalize a model that generates a wrong numerical value.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlso, we think that abstracting away tokenization differences is the role of the model\\/tokenizer: if you use the \\ud83e\\udd17Tokenizers library for example, it will handle that for you ;)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFinally, there is a lot of active research on developing model-powered metrics that are both more sensitive and more robust than ROUGE. Check out for example BERTscore, which is implemented in this library!\\\"] | ['I second this request. The bottom line is that **scores produced with different reference tokenizations are not comparable**. To discourage (even inadvertent) cheating, the user should never touch the reference. The `v13a` tokenization standard is not ideal, but at least it has been consistently used at matrix.statmt.org, facilitating comparisons.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSacrebleu exposes [all its data sources](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/mjpost\\/sacrebleu\\/blob\\/master\\/sacrebleu\\/dataset.py) and additionally provides [an API](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/mjpost\\/sacrebleu\\/blob\\/master\\/sacrebleu\\/__init__.py) to accessing the references, which seem to fit within the spirit of your codebase.', \\\"Didn't we have a slide and discussion at WMT admitting that, for production-quality models, BLEU doesn't correlate with human eval anyway?\\\\r\\\\n\\\", \\\"Yes, there are slides like that at WMT every year :) BLEU correlates with human judgment only at coarse levels, and it seems to be getting worse when people try to use it to do model selection among high-performing neural systems.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHowever, the point isn't whether BLEU is a good metric, but whether your BLEU score can be compared to other BLEU scores. They only can be compared if you use the same reference tokenization (similar to how you [can't compare LM perplexities across different segmentations](https:\\/\\/sjmielke.com\\/comparing-perplexities.htm)). sacrebleu was an attempt to get everyone to use WMT's reference tokenization (meaning, your system has to first remove its own tokenization) so that you could just compare across papers. This also prevents scores from being gamed.\\\", \\\"I do not consider as a sufficient solution switching this library's default metric from BLEU to the wrapper around SacreBLEU. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs currently implemented, the wrapper allows end users to toggle SacreBLEU options, but doesn't pass along the SacreBLEU signature. As @mjpost showed in [Post18](https:\\/\\/www.aclweb.org\\/anthology\\/W18-6319.pdf), it's simply not credible to assume that people will stick to the defaults, therefore, the signature is necessary to be explicit about what options were used. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn addition to the `v13a` or `intl` options for the SacreBLEU `tokenize` argument, which was pointed out earlier, papers frequently differ on whether they lowercase text before scoring (`lowercase`) and the smoothing method used (`smooth_method`). BLEU scores can differ substantially (over 1 BLEU) just by changing these options. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLosing the SacreBLEU signature is a regression in reproducibility and clarity.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n(Perhaps this should belong in a separate issue?)\\\", 'Thanks for sharing your thoughts. This is a very important discussion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlso one of the first items on our mid-term roadmap (we will try to clean it and share it soon) is to introduce mechanisms to get high-quality traceability and reproducibility for all the processes related to the library.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSo having the signature for `sacrebleu` is really important!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRegarding BLEU, I guess we can just remove it from the canonical metrics included in the repo itself (it won\\\\'t prevent people to add it as \\\"user-metrics\\\" but at least we won\\\\'t be promoting it).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn a more general note (definitely too large for the scope of this issue) we are wondering, with @srush in particular, how we could handle the selection of metrics\\/datasets with the most community-based and bottom-up approach possible. If you have opinions on this, please share!', 'Yeah, I would love to have discussions about ways this project can have an community-based, transparent process to arrive at strong default metrics. @kpu \\/ @mjpost do you have any suggestions of how that might work or pointers to places where this is done right? Perhaps this question can be template for what is likely to be repeated for other datasets.', \\\"I think @bittlingmayer is referring to Figure 6 in http:\\/\\/statmt.org\\/wmt19\\/pdf\\/53\\/WMT02.pdf .  When you look at Appendix A there are some cases where metrics fall apart at the high end and some where they correlate well.  en-zh is arguably production-quality.  \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis could evolve into a metrics Bazaar where the value add is really the packaging and consistency: it installs\\/compiles the metrics for me, gives a reproducible name to use in publication (involve the authors; you don't want a different sacrebleu hash system), a version number, and evaluation of the metrics like http:\\/\\/ufallab.ms.mff.cuni.cz\\/~bojar\\/wmt19-metrics-task-package.tgz but run when code changes rather than once a year.  \\\", 'While a Bazaar setup works for models \\/ datasets, I am not sure it is ideal for metrics ?

I would love to see this feature implemented as well :) Thank you for proposing your help !\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHere is a few things about the current implementation:\\\\r\\\\n- A dataset object is a wrapper of one `pyarrow.Table` that contains the data\\\\r\\\\n- Pyarrow offers an API that allows to transform Table objects. For example there are functions like `concat_tables`, `Table.rename_columns`, `Table.add_column` etc.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTherefore adding columns from another dataset is possible thanks to the pyarrow API and in particular `Table.add_column` :) \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHowever this breaks some features we have regarding pickle. A dataset object can be pickled and unpickled without loading all the data in memory. It is useful for multiprocessing for example. Pickling a dataset object is possible thanks to the `Dataset._data_files` which defines the list of arrow files that will be used to form the final Table (basically all the data from each files are concatenated on axis 0).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTherefore to be able to add columns to a Dataset and still be able to work with it in a multiprocessing setup, we need to extend this last aspect to be able to reconstruct a Table object from multiple arrow files that are combined in both axis 0 and 1. Currently this reconstruction mechanism only supports axis 0.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI'm sure we can figure something out that enables users to add columns from another dataset while keeping the multiprocessing support.\\\", '@lhoestq, we have two Pull Requests to implement:\\\\r\\\\n- Dataset.add_item: #1870\\\\r\\\\n- Dataset.add_column: #2145\\\\r\\\\nwhich add a single row or column, repectively.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe request here is to implement the concatenation of *multiple* rows\\/columns. Am I right?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe should agree on the API:\\\\r\\\\n- `concatenate_datasets` with `axis`?\\\\r\\\\n- other Dataset method name?', \\\"For the API, I like `concatenate_datasets` with `axis` personally :)\\\\r\\\\nFrom a list of `Dataset` objects, it would concatenate them to a new `Dataset` object backed by a `ConcatenationTable`, that is the concatenation of the tables of each input dataset. The concatenation is either on axis=0 (append rows) or on axis=1 (append columns).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRegarding what we need to implement:\\\\r\\\\nThe axis=0 is already supported and is the current behavior of `concatenate_datasets`.\\\\r\\\\nAlso `add_item` is not needed to implement axis=1 (though it's an awesome addition to this library).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo implement axis=1, we either need `add_column` or a `ConcatenationTable` constructor to concatenate tables horizontally.\\\\r\\\\nI have a preference for using a `ConcatenationTable` constructor because this way we can end up with a `ConcatenationTable` with only 1 additional block per table, while `add_column` would add 1 block per new column.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMaybe we can simply have an equivalent of `ConcatenationTable.from_tables` but for axis=1 ?\\\\r\\\\n`axis` could also be an argument of `ConcatenationTable.from_tables`\\\", '@lhoestq I think I guessed your suggestions in advance... \\ud83d\\ude09 #2151', \\\"Cool !
